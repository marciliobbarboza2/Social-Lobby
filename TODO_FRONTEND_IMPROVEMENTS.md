# TODO: Frontend Improvements

## Current Status
- Facebook-like layout is implemented with sidebars and feed.
- Header component exists but lacks styling and search functionality.
- UI has basic styling but can be enhanced with better spacing, hover effects, and modern design.

## Tasks
- [x] Add CSS styles for .socialobby-header in App.css (sticky positioning, background, alignment, responsive).
- [x] Add search bar to Header.jsx for searching users/posts.
- [x] Enhance overall UI with better spacing, hover effects, and modern gradients.
- [ ] Test header functionality and responsiveness.
- [ ] Verify improvements work on different screen sizes.
